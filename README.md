Single-file documentation for Create Your Frisk using TiddlyWiki5. Because I like TiddlyWiki.

## Licenses
Because Create Your Frisk is released under the GPL3 license, and this project uses text and css lifted directly from CYF's original documentation, this project is also released under GPL3. 

Changes from the original documentation include reformatting, slight rewordings, and the removal of certain informative (but less than we'd hope) tags.

All other licenses related to TiddlyWiki5 and plugins used within it can be found either within Tiddlywiki_Licenses or within the wiki itself.
