title: The Default Directory

Unitale and Create Your Frisk both have a "Default" directory. This is where resources from Undertale reside. It is not advised to modify files in this directory, as they are expected to be the same across all installations.

If you wish to replace any of the default files for your mod, create a new file with the same name and location instead. For instance, if you want to change the player soul hurt sound, don't replace `Default/Sounds/hurtsound.wav`. Instead, create a new file located at `modname/Sounds/hurtsound.wav`. This also goes for sprites, music, and even fonts.
